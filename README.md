# Image captioning

A Node.js package for generating captions for images using TensorFlow.js and pre-trained models.

# Installation
Install the package via npm:
    `npm install image-captioning`

# Usage
```JavaScript
    const imageCaptioning = require('image-captioning');
    const imagePath = 'path/to/your/image.jpg';
    imageCaptioning.getImageCaptions(imagePath)
        .then(captions => {
            console.log('Captions:', captions);
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.error('Error:', error);
        });
```

# API
getImageCaptions(imagePath)
- Generates captions for the image located at imagePath.

imagePath (string): Path to the image file.
- Returns a Promise that resolves with an array of captions generated for the image.

# Dependencies
@tensorflow/tfjs
@tensorflow-models/coco-ssd

# Predictions
This npm package utilizes TensorFlow.js to analyze images and extract objects, enabling it to make predictions. Based on these predictions, captions are generated for the images. It's important to note that while this package provides an initial initiative towards image captioning, the accuracy of the captions may vary. Further training of the TensorFlow models may be required to improve the accuracy of the captions.
