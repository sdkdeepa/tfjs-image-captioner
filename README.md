# Effortless Image Captioning with TensorFlow.js

Generate image captions directly in your web or Node.js projects using pre-trained TensorFlow.js models. Ideal for web developers, designers, and researchers to add visual understanding and accessibility to their applications.

# Key Features:

* Simple API: Get captions with one line of code.
* Pre-trained Model Flexibility: Choose from different pre-trained models for varying accuracy and performance needs.
* Multiple Image Formats: Supports common image formats like JPEG, PNG, and more.
* Code Examples: Learn how to integrate the package into your projects with clear examples.

# Installation:

```bash
npm install tfjs-image-captioner
```
# Usage

```JavaScript
import imageCaptioning from 'tfjs-image-captioner';

const imagePath = 'path/to/your/image.jpg';
imageCaptioning.getImageCaptions(imagePath)
  .then(captions => {
    console.log('Captions:', captions);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });
```
